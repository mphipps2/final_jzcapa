The jcapa_env_lxplus.sh script functions conceptually like the cmsenv command. You run it if you want to work with JCaPA and cmake.

It launches a new bash from which you can play with JCaPA with the appropriate paths for cmake.

DO NOT EDIT YOUR .BASHRC everythign unrelated to JCaPA will break all versions of cmssw will fail. (you of course can always remove these edits and cmssw will work again)


The purpose is to make getting the correct paths simple and easy.
