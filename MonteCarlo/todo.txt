MAIN
-Enable multithreading. Special considerations must be taken when storing std::vector
  in root files.

CONSTRUCTION
-Implement an environment flag. i.e. ATLAS, SPS TestBeam, FNAL TestBeam
-Add cladding and buffer to ZDC and RPD
-Make RPD volume vectors instead of fixed length arrays
-Make a method to set remaining ZDC/RPD values to default before construction
-Make something to handle if both FiberPitch and TileSize are specified by user

SENSITIVEDETECTORS
-Make fiber SD detect only photons at the top of the volume if OPTICAL is true
  -Probably separate this into two function
-Determine if rodNum/radNum are necessary
