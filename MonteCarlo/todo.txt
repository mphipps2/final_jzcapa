MAIN
-Enable multithreading. Special considerations must be taken when storing std::vector
  in root files.
  Ref: https://indico.cern.ch/event/217511/contributions/444924/attachments/349283/486922/root_in_geant4.pdf
-Add geometry.mac with DetectorMessenger commands

CONSTRUCTION
-Remake ModTypeZDC with parameters set by DetectorMessenger and materials from Materials.hh
-Make DetectorMessenger that talks to DetectorConstruction, ModTypeRPD and ModTypeZDC
-Set sim cherenkov option in physics list. (maybe set it in detector construction)
-Create an environment flag. i.e. ATLAS, SPS TestBeam, FNAL TestBeam
-Replace rpd construction with pan flute
-Give zdc construction materials only from Materials class
-Make zdc with vectors instead of fixed length arrays

SENSITIVEDETECTORS
-Make fiber SD detect only photons at the top of the volume if OPTICAL is true
  -Probably separate this into two function
-Figure out how to kill Cherenkov photons from the SD
-Determine if rodNum/radNum are necessary

STEPPINGACTION
-Fill last step in volume properly
-Remove stepping action if lastStep works in EventAction

OUTPUT
-Pass output file name to run action
-Add gun position to branch in event action
-Check to see if LastStepInVolume works in EventAction


PHYSICS
-Clean up commented out lines



*** By Priority ***
/// Necessary
-Pass output file name to run action
-Finish DetectorMessenger
-Add geometry.mac with DetectorMessenger commands

// Completeness
-Replace rpd construction with pan flute
-Try making vectors in EventAction not contain pointers
-Give zdc construction materials only from Materials class
-Make zdc with vectors instead of fixed length arrays
-Fill last step in volume properly
-Add gun position to branch in event action

// Quality of life
-Clean up commented out lines
-Enable multithreading. Special considerations must be taken when storing std::vector
  in root files.
