MAIN
-Enable multithreading. Special considerations must be taken when storing std::vector
  in root files.

CONSTRUCTION
-Implement an environment flag. i.e. ATLAS, SPS TestBeam, FNAL TestBeam
-Add cladding and buffer to ZDC and RPD
-Make RPD volume vectors instead of fixed length arrays
-Make a method to set remaining ZDC/RPD values to default before construction
-Make something to handle if both FiberPitch and TileSize are specified by user

SENSITIVEDETECTORS
-Make fiber SD detect only photons at the top of the volume if OPTICAL is true
  -Probably separate this into two function
-Determine if rodNum/radNum are necessary

STEPPINGACTION
-Remove lastStep if it works in EventAction

OUTPUT
-Pass output file name to run action
-Check to see if LastStepInVolume works in EventAction


PHYSICS
-Clean up commented out lines



*** By Priority ***
/// Necessary
-Make fiber SD detect only photons at the top of the volume if OPTICAL is true
  -Probably separate this into two function
-Pass output file name to run action

// Completeness
-Remove lastStep if it works in EventAction
-Determine if rodNum/radNum are necessary
-Try making vectors in EventAction not contain pointers
-Create an environment flag. i.e. ATLAS, SPS TestBeam, FNAL TestBeam
-Make RPD volume vectors instead of fixed length arrays
-Add cladding and buffer to RPD::ConstructPrototypeDetector

// Quality of life
-Clean up commented out lines
-Make RPD volume vectors instead of fixed length arrays
-Enable multithreading. Special considerations must be taken when storing std::vector
  in root files.
