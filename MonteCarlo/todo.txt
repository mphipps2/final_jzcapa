MAIN
-Enable multithreading. Special considerations must be taken when storing std::vector
  in root files.
  Ref: https://indico.cern.ch/event/217511/contributions/444924/attachments/349283/486922/root_in_geant4.pdf
-Make args with flags
-Add geometry.mac with DetectorMessenger commands

CONSTRUCTION
-Make DetectorMessenger that talks to DetectorConstruction, ModTypeRPD and ModTypeZDC
-Set sim cherenkov option in physics list. (maybe set it in detector construction)
-Replace rpd construction with pan flute
-Give zdc construction materials only from Materials class
-Make zdc with vectors instead of fixed length arrays

SENSITIVEDETECTORS
-Single SD that has a flag depending on use?
  Could be better than having an optical flag passed around

STEPPINGACTION
-Fill last step in volume properly

OUTPUT
-Add analysis class
-Add gun position to branch in event action
-Figure out how to separate detector hit collections in event action properly
-Change output vector storage form run action to event action
-Make a cluster flag to reduce branches (reducedTree)

PHYSICS
-Clean up commented out lines



*** By Priority ***
/// Necessary
-Add analysis class
-Single SD that has a flag depending on use?
  Could be better than having an optical flag passed around
-Figure out how to separate detector hit collections in event action properly
  Make sd names a  formatted string based on detector
-Change output vector storage form run action to event action
-Make DetectorMessenger that talks to;
  DetectorConstruction, ModTypeRPD and ModTypeZDC, PhysicsList, RunAction
-Add geometry.mac with DetectorMessenger commands
-Set sim cherenkov option in physics list. (maybe set it in detector construction)
-Make a cluster flag to reduce branches (reducedTree)

// Completeness
-Replace rpd construction with pan flute
-Give zdc construction materials only from Materials class

-Fill last step in volume properly
-Add gun position to branch in event action

// Quality of life
-Clean up commented out lines
-Make args with flags
-Enable multithreading. Special considerations must be taken when storing std::vector
